Each line of the grid is separated from the next by a linebreak. </p></li><li><p>Output: a number between 0 and <code>n</code>, inclusive. The return number represents the minimum number of periods to be replaced with x's to obtain a straight n-length path of x's.</p></li></ul><h1 id="example">Example:</h1><ul><li>Input:</li></ul><pre><code>  ..x..  .....  .....  ..x..  xx..x </code></pre><ul><li>Output: <code>2</code></li></ul><p>As you can see, in the last row (xx..x) of the grid, you only need to replace two periods with x's to get a straight n-length path of x's in the grid. Any other row, column, or diagonal will require more replacements than 2. So 2 is the minimum number of periods to be replaced with x's. </p><p>For more examples check out the Example Test Cases. </p>
