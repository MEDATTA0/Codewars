At that point, obtain a count of the maximum amount of consecutive 0s. From there, return the count in written form with a capital letter.</p><pre><code class="language-ruby"><span class="cm-variable">max_consec_zeros</span>(<span class="cm-string">"9"</span>) <span class="cm-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="cm-string">"Two"</span><span class="cm-variable">max_consec_zeros</span>(<span class="cm-string">"13"</span>) <span class="cm-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="cm-string">"One"</span><span class="cm-variable">max_consec_zeros</span>(<span class="cm-string">"15"</span>) <span class="cm-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="cm-string">"Zero"</span><span class="cm-variable">max_consec_zeros</span>(<span class="cm-string">"42"</span>) <span class="cm-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="cm-string">"One"</span><span class="cm-variable">max_consec_zeros</span>(<span class="cm-string">"550"</span>) <span class="cm-operator">=&gt;</span> <span class="cm-string">"Three"</span></code></pre><p>In the very first example, we have an argument of <code>"9"</code> which is being passed to the method. The binary representation of <code>9</code> is <code>1001</code> which can be read as: one, zero, zero, one. There are, at most, two consecutive 0s, resulting in the integer <code>2</code> as the value of the count. The output in the block of code above reflects the final step of taking <code>2</code> from standard form to the written form <code>"Two"</code> as prompted.</p><p>In the very last example, we have an argument of <code>"550"</code> which is being passed to the method. The binary representation of <code>550</code> is <code>1000100110</code> which can be read as: one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, zero. There are, at most, three consecutive 0s, resulting in the integer <code>3</code> as the value of the count. The output in the block of code above reflects the final step of taking <code>3</code> from standard form to the written form of <code>"Three"</code> as prompted.</p><p>One way, among many, to visualize the end of each step might look like:</p><pre><code>max_consec_zeros("777")1: "777"2: 7773: 11000010014: 45: "Four"max_consec_zeros("777") =&gt; "Four"</code></pre><p>Happy coding!</p>
